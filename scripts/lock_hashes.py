"""Rewrite the lock files so every pin carries the hashes pip must verify.

The lock file names an exact version of each runtime dependency. That says what
to install but not what the bytes should be, so an installer following it takes
whatever the index hands over. Adding the hashes lets pip be run with
--require-hashes, which refuses anything it was not told to expect.

Every published file for a pinned version is listed, not only the one this
machine would choose. The image builds for amd64, arm64 and arm/v7, and a
package that ships more than one wheel would offer each of them a different
file. Both runtime dependencies are pure Python today and ship one wheel each,
so the lists are short, but a hash list missing the wheel that gets selected
fails the install rather than merely skipping the check.

The hashes come from the PyPI JSON API, which reports the digest the index
itself holds for each file. Nothing is downloaded and nothing is executed.

    python scripts/lock_hashes.py                 rewrite both lock files
    python scripts/lock_hashes.py --check         exit 1 if it would change

The version pins and the environment markers are left exactly as they are. To
move a version, edit the pin by hand as before and then run this.
